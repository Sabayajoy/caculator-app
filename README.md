I've created a simple but functional calculator with a clean, modern design. 
Here are the key features:

Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)
Additional operations (%, ±)
Clear function (C)
Decimal point support
Responsive design with CSS Grid
Color-coded buttons for different operations
Hover effects for better user interaction

The calculator includes:

A display area showing current input/result
A grid layout of buttons
Error handling for basic calculations
Proper decimal handling
Chaining of operations
